## üìÑ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a **GUI-based AES-256 Encryption Tool** developed in Python using IDLE. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files with a password, simulating real-world data protection practices.

The project provides a user-friendly interface to understand how encryption works using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm.

## üîß FEATURES

- **AES-256 Encryption:**  
  Encrypt any file with a password using AES-CBC mode.

- **Secure Decryption:**  
  Decrypt `.enc` files only with the correct password.

- **GUI Interface:**  
  Built with Tkinter for easy usage‚Äîno coding required.

- **Error Handling:**  
  User-friendly alerts for missing input or incorrect passwords.

## üßë‚Äçüíª TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Python 3.9+  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- PyCryptodome (AES, SHA256)  
- IDLE (Python IDE)

---

## üß™ HOW TO PERFORM THIS PRACTICAL

1. **Create a folder** (e.g., `Q_3`) and add the following files:
   - `gui.py`
   - `encryption_tool.py`

2. **Install required module (if not already):**
      pip install pycryptodome

3. **Open `gui.py` in IDLE** and run the script.

4. In the GUI:
- Click **Browse File** and select the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- Enter a **secret password**.
- Click **Encrypt üîí** to create a `.enc` file, or **Decrypt üîì** to restore the original.
